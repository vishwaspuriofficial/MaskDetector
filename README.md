# MaskDetector
A program that live detects if you are wearing a mask or not!

It uses OpenCV and image analysis to detect the human's face and mainly the characteristics of a nose and mouth using machine learning models and uses the information to predict if a user is wearing a mask or not.

This program is made using python supported by streamlit.

This program could be used to make many innovative projects that require fical detection and/or mask tracking, especially in this COVID time.
